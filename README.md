K-Means Clustering for Image Compression
This repository contains the implementation of the K-means algorithm for image compression. The goal is to reduce the number of colors in an image by clustering similar colors together. This process not only helps in compressing the image but also provides an intuitive understanding of how the K-means clustering algorithm works.

Overview
The project is structured as follows:

K-means Algorithm Implementation: Custom implementation of the K-means algorithm.
Image Compression: Application of K-means to compress an image by reducing its color space.
Dependencies
numpy
matplotlib
scipy (optional for loading .mat files if experimenting with additional datasets)
Ensure you have the required packages installed by running:

bash

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
Usage
The project is divided into several key components:

Finding Closest Centroids: Implementing the function to find the closest centroid for each data point.
Computing Centroid Means: Recalculating the centroids based on the mean of the points assigned to each cluster.
Applying K-means on a Sample Dataset: Understanding the K-means clustering with a 2D dataset.
Image Compression with K-means: Reducing the color space of an image from thousands of colors to a specified number (e.g., 16 colors).
Sample Code Snippets
Finding Closest Centroids:
python

def find_closest_centroids(X, centroids):
    idx = np.zeros(X.shape[0], dtype=int)
    # Your implementation here
    return idx
Computing New Centroids:
python

def compute_centroids(X, idx, K):
    centroids = np.zeros((K, X.shape[1]))
    # Your implementation here
    return centroids
Running K-Means Clustering:
python

# Initialize centroids and run K-means
initial_centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)
centroids, idx = run_kMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters)
Image Compression:
Load your image and preprocess it:
python

original_img = plt.imread('path/to/your/image.png')
X_img = np.reshape(original_img, (original_img.shape[0] * original_img.shape[1], 3))
Compress the image:
python

# Running K-means on the image data
K = 16  # Number of colors
centroids, idx = run_kMeans(X_img, initial_centroids, max_iters)
Recover the image based on the centroids assigned to each pixel:
python

X_recovered = centroids[idx, :]
X_recovered = np.reshape(X_recovered, original_img.shape)
Visualizing the Results
After compressing the image, you can visualize the original and compressed images side by side:

python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))
ax[0].imshow(original_img)
ax[0].set_title('Original Image')
ax[1].imshow(X_recovered)
ax[1].set_title('Compressed Image with K=%d' % K)
plt.show()
